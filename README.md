# Crowd Control - Zombies Ate My Neighbors (SNES)

Requirements:
* A rom of the USA version of "Zombies Ate My Neighbors" for the SNES.
* Patched with the [CC patch](https://github.com/WarpWorld/CrowdControl-SNES-ZombiesAteMyNeighbors/blob/main/ZombiesAteMyNeighbors.bps). 
* The Crowd Control SDK

You can find more info at on the SDK at https://forum.warp.world/t/how-to-setup-and-use-the-crowd-control-sdk/5121

This version of the game pack has support and effects for player 1 and 2. In testing, we had bugs and crashes when effects happened to player 2, so we pushed without that support.
